Computer uses different encoding - the language (binary) is made of zeroes and ones.
With these you can form any number. Using some form of encoding,
you can represent other thigns like characters, sounds, video etc.
API - application programming interface is just a fancy way to say, that
you can use some messages to a device to instruct it to do what you want it
to do.
