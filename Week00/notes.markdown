## Lecture ##

Computer uses different encoding - the language (binary) is made of zeroes and ones.
With these you can form any number. Using some form of encoding,
you can represent other thigns like characters, sounds, video etc.
API - application programming interface is just a fancy way to say, that
you can use some messages to a device to instruct it to do what you want it
to do. 

## Algorithms ##

Algorithm is just a set of instructions, a way to solve a problem.
It is made up of set of smaller steps.
There are usually many ways to solve a problem - and many algorithms.
Different algorithms to solve a problem will have different pros and cons
- one can be fast, but expensive on memory, other can be slow but
efficient with memory usage.
So you need to know what are your priorities - then you can choose the
best approach to the problem.
