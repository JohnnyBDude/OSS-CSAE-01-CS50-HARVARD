## Lecture

### Scratch and C

The same blocks of puzzles, that we use in scratch to implement an algorithm we can also use in C - it is just a different syntax
different language to express the same ideas.
C lets you express your ideas more precisely, so the computer only does what you tell it to do - and hence it is more efficient
(that means quicker).

### Source code and Object code

People understand text as characters, computers (processors in them) understand commands in zeroes and ones -
so you need a program, that takes your human readable code ( i.e. source code) and translates it into 
computer readable code (object code).

### Terminal environment

You can use pretty graphical environments to control your computer, but you can also use so called terminal, which is
an application, that provides you with command line interface - you just type in the commands and computer prints 
back the outputs from them.
